## 📌 About the Project

Krushi is an AI-based web application developed to help farmers make smarter agricultural decisions.
The system predicts crop yield, estimates farming costs, and provides fertilizer recommendations using Machine Learning.

The goal of this project is to promote smart and sustainable agriculture using modern technology.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User logs into the system.
2. User enters crop details like rainfall, temperature, fertilizer usage, and land size.
3. The backend sends data to the trained ML model.
4. The model predicts:

   * Expected crop yield
   * Estimated cost
   * Farming recommendations
5. Results are displayed on the dashboard.

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained using agricultural datasets containing:

* Rainfall data
* Temperature data
* Fertilizer usage
* Crop type
* Yield output

Datasets were stored in CSV format and used for training the ML model.
